# Example Module: Linear Algebra in Engineering
## by Ryan C. Cooper @cooperrc
### Accelerated Learning Module for Building a student-centered learning community in Jupyter

The original repositories for the Spring 2020 Computational Mechanics
course are here: [Computational Mechanics
homepage](https://github.uconn.edu/rcc02007/Computational_Mechanics/). 

Student-centered learning includes breaking up content with questions,
[problem-based learning](), and [project-based learning](). Each
student-centered learning activity contributes to the learning journey
that the student experiences. The engineering problem-solving process
includes eight steps: 

1. Identifying previous knowledge and how it relates to the current
problem: in this case we have systems of equations
2. Introduce a new model: In this case we are introducing Linear Algebra
to solve systems of equations
3. Problem-based work: These include tutorials and homework assignments
where the process can be applied. In this case 
4. Project-based work: the goal is defined, but the process must be
created by the student
5. Achieve the goal: The student at this point should have an
understanding of the material
6. Share the work: The student needs to share the work to see how the
material applies to engineering design work
7. Submit project: this step includes communicating the result, getting
feedback, and preparing for the final step
8. New knowledge and skills: after submitting the project, the student
reflects on lessons learned and integrates these new skills into their
engineering design, ready for the next module or _journey_

In this
example module, we walk through an accelerated engineering application to use
Linear Algebra to solve a problem.
